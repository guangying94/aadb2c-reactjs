# Azure AD B2C Quick Start with React JS
Sample code for Azure AD B2C &amp; React JS. This is using default React JS template, with Azure AD B2C. Full technical description can be found in my Medium Blog: [Azure AD B2C Quick Start for React JS Single Page AppsÂ (SPA)](https://marcustee.medium.com/azure-ad-b2c-quick-start-for-react-js-single-page-apps-spa-38a70d13acd).



## Get Started
Assuming that you already have the necessary Azure AD B2C parameters, you can modify [authConfig.js](https://github.com/guangying94/aadb2c-reactjs/blob/main/aadb2c-app/src/authConfig.js), replace the parameter inside <xxx> with your own value and the app should run with your Azure AD B2C.
